# Project Overview
Wearable sensors with Human Activity Recognition revolutionize medical diagnostics, monitoring patient movements in real-time for early anomaly detection and personalized interventions. This improves outcomes and cuts healthcare costs. Thus we introduce our device - "Monitwatch," a compact wearable device that integrates various sensors like heart rate, SpO2, EEG, and motion sensors. It measures crucial health metrics such as SpO2 levels, heart rate, temperature, and patient movement data. It also features a lightweight "vest" with integrated detection probe interfaces  monitors cardiovascular and muscular activity using ECG, EOG, and EEG probes. Small probes detect abnormalities, including those leading to heart attacks, while gyroscope sensors accurately detect mobility accidents such as falls. Encoded results from sensors are processed by an autoencoder model while patient motion tracking data is monitored and analyzed using an RNN-based LSTM model for comprehensive health insights. Predictions are decoded and compared to actual outcomes, generating alerts if discrepancies exceed a set threshold. Alerts promptly notify patients of abnormalities, enabling timely intervention and treatment.
